# LearningGitHub
This is a readme file

1. I made this repo on  github
2. Make a directory on PC to contain all your git repos
3. I cloned this git repo into my computer using the following command:
       git clone https://github.com/NilanjanaLodh/LearningGitHub.git
    

    This creates a copy of the repo on your computer in the directory 
    called LearningGitHub

4. I then created a new branch and edited the README file in the branch 
    command :   git checkout -b branchtest
